This is the README file for the 'bedrock' project.

Overview
========

Bedrock is a server side web development framework that can be used
with Apache web servers. It allows HTML programmers to create dynamic
web pages through the use of a small set of HTML-like tags. Bedrock is
an enabling technology that glues together HTML pages and dynamic data
(HTML form data, data from databases, and system services) to create
web applications.

Bedrock differs significantly from most web application development
environments that either generate HTML pages as output (e.g. CGIs, Servlets)
or are themselves programs embedded within HTML pages (e.g. PHP, Mason, ASP,
etc) by allowing the developer to assemble pages from object oriented
components.

Although Bedrock has grown to include many features, some of which are
not found in other web application environments, some interesting and
robust applications can be built with only 7 Bedrock tags:

  <if>
  <null>
  <var>
  <sqlselect>
  <sql>
  <sqlconnect>
  <foreach>

At the time of writing (2010-11-22), the project is being cleaned up after a
long period of inactivity. Version 1.6.4 was released in 2001, and since then
most production environments have been running a variation of that version,
usually with minor modifications.

Such modifications have been recently collected and tagged in CVS as version
1.6.5.

The project is currently being revived to allow it to run on Apache 2.x
version servers (versions through 1.6.5 worked only on Apache 1.3.x).

See the "Prerequisites" section below for other programs that must be
installed and configured on your system before you can install the 'bedrock'
package.


See the 'BUGS' file for information on reporting bugs.

See the 'INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

See the 'HACKING' file for developer build instructions and the like.

See the 'NEWS' file for changes for this release, and a running list of
changes from previous releases. Any incompatibilities with previous versions
will be noted in the 'NEWS' file.


Prerequisites
=============
'bedrock' is intended to be built on Unix and Unix-like systems, so expects a
standard set of utilities (cat, sed, awk, rm, ...) to be present. These
utilities are not explicitly listed below as prerequisites as they should be
present on any modern Unix or GNU/Linux system (or Cygwin, if the Universe
hates you ;-). We also do not explicitly list those Perl modules that are part
of the core library shipped with Perl (e.g., Data::Dumper, MIME::Base64, etc.)

The various 'bedrock' components are primarily implemented in Perl, so of
course a Perl installation is needed. Current 'bedrock' development is done
using Perl 5.8.8, but any 5.8.x+ features that are used should be
conditional. This means that Bedrock should work with versions of Perl prior
to 5.8.x, as well.

If you're installing Bedrock from a Debian .deb file or a RedHat rpm
file, you should have success letting the package managers pull the
dependencies for you.  If you insist on doing this the hard way then
you'll need to make sure you have the proper dependencies installed
before proceeding.


Special Note Regarding Apache Versions
======================================

Bedrock 2.x has been modified and tested to work primarily in conjunction with 
Apache 2.2 and later.  If you REALLY want to make Bedrock 2.0 work
with previous versions of Apache it can be done, however please note
the following caveats:

  - Apache::Bedrock (2) under mod_perl 1 will not work as it has been
    specifically modified to work with mod_perl 2.  If this becomes an
    issue or a grassroots campaign is mounted, a replacement
    Apache::Bedrock that works with mod_perl 1 may be released in the
    future.

  - Bedrock running as a CGI should work with no compatibility issues
    under Apache 1.x/2.0/2.2.

  - To run Bedrock 2.0 under Apache 2.0.x you may want to make the
    following tweak after configure your site to work with Bedrock:

    + remove the word "virtual" from the `bedrock.conf.in' file
      found in src/main/bedrock/config

      This is necessary because Apache 2.0 lacks the virtual attribute
      on the handler and checks for existence before invoking the
      handler.  This would resulting in a 404 error if the directory
      did not exist.

      Action        bedrock-cgi /cgi-bin/bedrock.cgi virtual

    + remove the 'tag' directory in the /bedrock directory and
      replace this with an empty file:

      sudo rmdir /var/www/myvhost.com/htdocs/bedrock/tag
      sudo touch /var/www/myvhost.com/htdocs/bedrock/tag


  - The "experimental" Bedrock framework will not work properly under
    mod_perl 1.0 since it relies on the 'virtual' attribute for an
    Apache handler introduced in Apache 2.2, although it "may" work
    with Bedrock running as a CGI handler.


Installing and Configuring a Bedrock Enabled Website
====================================================

Installing Bedrock "should be" a simple 2-step process.

1. Install core-Bedrock

   - Download the tar ball and read the 'INSTALL' file or

   - Download the .deb file and use dpkg to install Bedrock and the dependencies

   - Download the .rpm file and use yum to install Bedrock and the
     dependencies

2. Configure your Apache server to enable Bedrock

   - See the 'README.Apache' file.


Creating a persistent Session Database
======================================

Bedrock implements persistent user sessions using an application
plugin called BLM::Startup::UserSession.  The reference implementation
installed by Bedrock uses a MySQL database persist user data.

There are also implementations using PostgreSQL and SQLLite.

To create the database and table necessary to use the Bedrock $session
object, you'll want to do something similar to:

  $ mysqladmin -u root -p create bedrock

  $ cat /usr/share/bedrock/create-session.sql | mysql -u root -p bedrock
