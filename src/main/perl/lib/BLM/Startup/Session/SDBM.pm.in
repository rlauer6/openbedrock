# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.

# Implementation of Bedrock session class which uses SDBM for
# storage. Caveat with this module is that session data has an upper
# limit of 1 KB. Use this if you want to store only one or two scalars
# per session.
