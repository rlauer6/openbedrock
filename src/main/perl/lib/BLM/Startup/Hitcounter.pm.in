# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.5  2009/12/28 20:32:33  rlauer
# move SIS:: up to Bedrock::
#
# Revision 1.4  2008/12/03 14:01:19  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/02/14 15:35:46  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/11/07 21:52:05  sridhar
# 1. Using BEDROCK_URI as the key instead of some junk.
# 2. Dying if some required vars not set in config.
# 3. Can retrieve `count', `dated' and `viewed_by'.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/10/12 15:22:48  sridhar
# Bedrock can now boast of hit counter capability.
