# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.

=head1 PUBLIC 

C<BLM::Include> - Include the contents of a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <plugin:Include "/var/www/html/notes.txt">
 <pre
 <var $Include.include()>
 </pre>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Includes the specified file without Bedrock parsing, into the current position of the page.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 include

Include the entire contents of a file at this point in the page without Bedrock parsing.

=head2 set

Set the input record separator to a non-default value. Most of the
time you won't use this method, but you could for example, set the
record separator to something other than <undef> to read the file one
line at a time using the C<nextRecord> method.

=head2 nextRecord

Returns the next record in the data file or undef if end-of-file.
