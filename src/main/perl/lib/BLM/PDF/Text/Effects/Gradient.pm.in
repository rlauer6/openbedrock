Gradient effect for text

=over 4

=item *
B<gradient>       When a draw operation is performed, the color
                  of the text will be interpolated from 
                  the colors (rl, gl, bl)..(rr, gr, br)

=item *
B<gradient_smooth>Defines if gradients will flow smoothly through
                  characters or interpolation will be character
                  based. Zero or nonzero. Default is nonzero.
