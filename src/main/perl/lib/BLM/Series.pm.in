# Revision 1.5  2009/12/28 20:32:33  rlauer
# move SIS:: up to Bedrock::

# Revision 1.4  2008/12/03 14:01:19  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/02/14 15:35:44  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/11/30 14:26:52  sridhar
# Added CVS headers
