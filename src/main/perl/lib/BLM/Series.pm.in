# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.

C<BLM::Series> - generate an arithmetic series as a Bedrock array.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <plugin:Series>
 <null:months $Series.arithmetic(1,1,12)>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns an array that consists of a series of numbers generated
arithmetically by starting at a given integer, incrementing by a
certain value for a given length.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 arithmetic( start, increment, length )

=over 5

=item * start

Starting value

=item * increment

value to increment by each time

=item * length

number of elements to return
