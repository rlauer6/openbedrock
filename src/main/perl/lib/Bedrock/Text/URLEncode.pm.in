# Modifications are done as follows: Refer to RFC 2396 for details.
# The following classes of characters are escaped:
#    Reserved chars: ;/?:@&=+$,
#    Excluded chars: < >, a space char
#    Delimiters: <>#%"
#    Unwise characters: {}|\^[]`
# The following class is not included, but could be included if need arises
#    Unreserved marks: -_.!~*'()
# In addition, chars in the range \x00 - \x1f and \x7f should be escaped, but
# need hasn't arisen for that yet.
# Update: I added support for \x0a (newline) because the need has arisen. -Al
# NOTE: Routine doesn't return anything. The arguments are modified directly

# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.8  2011/07/12 19:10:36  eutl420
# set VERSION from cvs Revision keyword
#
# Revision 1.7  2010/12/06 14:15:53  rlauer
# - added subroutines htmlencode, Htmlencode to centralize this functionality
#   and make it available to <var> and Bedrock::Dump
#
# Revision 1.6  2010/11/29 15:57:53  rlauer
# - change openbedrock.org to openbedrock.net
#
# Revision 1.5  2008/12/03 14:01:19  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.4  2005/02/22 20:12:54  aviert
# The following changes have been taken from the current production environment, located
# on cjx-devl. There are minor differences between what's currently in the repository
# and what's there, due to ad-hoc bug fixes that never made their way back into cvs.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/02/14 15:35:48  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/06/01 17:24:30  sridhar
# 1. Added Decode functions for decoding encoded URIs
# 2. Defined @EXPORT_OK tags for optional exports.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/02/04 16:05:44  sridhar
