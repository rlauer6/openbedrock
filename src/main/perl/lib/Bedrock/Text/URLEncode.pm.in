# Routine modifies the arguments to escape the characters. Pass one or more
# arguments. The arguments are URLencoded.
# Modifications are done as follows: Refer to RFC 2396 for details.
# The following classes of characters are escaped:
#    Reserved chars: ;/?:@&=+$,
#    Excluded chars: < >, a space char
#    Delimiters: <>#%"
#    Unwise characters: {}|\^[]`
# The following class is not included, but could be included if need arises
#    Unreserved marks: -_.!~*'()
# In addition, chars in the range \x00 - \x1f and \x7f should be escaped, but
# need hasn't arisen for that yet.
# NOTE: Routine doesn't return anything. The arguments are modified directly
