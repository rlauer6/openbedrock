# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.5  2008/12/03 14:01:21  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.4  2001/02/14 15:35:51  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/07/20 20:11:42  sridhar
# Removed facility for evaluation variable in string if first char in
# string is a `$'. Basically no evaluation in string.
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/05/31 14:23:30  sridhar
# Rigorous version numbering and usage
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/04/13 15:14:23  sridhar
# Adding TagX::Term::String -- class to handle string parts of an
# expression.
