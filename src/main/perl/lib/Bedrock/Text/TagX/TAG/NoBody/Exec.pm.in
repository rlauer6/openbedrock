#
# Revision 1.13  2008/12/03 14:01:20  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.12  2008/11/25 19:04:13  rlauer
# changes based on Bedrock 2.0 migration plan
#
# Revision 1.11  2001/02/14 15:35:49  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.10  2001/02/13 15:59:48  sridhar
# No argument required for expand-args. It is a flag which is turned on
# if present.
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/12/14 17:57:47  sridhar
# Fixed bug in passing args to <exec> with buffer. The buffer was not
# being removed from @argv before passing the args to the buffer.
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/12/06 18:54:03  sridhar
# Extension `.peb' is appended to the pebble name if not already there
# to arrive at the pebble file name.
#
# Revision 1.7  2000/11/29 20:58:34  sridhar
# 1. Support for pebbles -- file to be included is taken from a
# directory which is configured as PEBBLE_DIR
# 2. No expanding of arguments by default. --expand-args must be
# specified to expand any array arguments.
#
# Revision 1.6  2000/11/22 15:29:29  sridhar
# 1. Parameters can now be passed to <exec>.
# 2. Exec is more like a subroutine call in that a stack frame is
# created on invocation which goes away when the exec is done. Variables
# are created in the current stack frame and do not clobber global or
# variables from parent's stack frames.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/11/16 19:09:13  sridhar
# Fixed error messages so location of error in perl source is not
# visible.
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/11/01 16:09:00  sridhar
# Yuck! Previous commit had a syntax error
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/11/01 16:05:25  sridhar
# Croaking if arg to --file is a directory
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/10/31 21:47:39  sridhar
# Bug fix: characters following the closing '>' after <exec> and <include>
# were being discarded due to $_ being clobbered when `output()' was
# reinvoked with new file.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/08/17 17:22:50  sridhar
# Adding support for <exec> tag for executing bedrock code from files or
# from variables.
