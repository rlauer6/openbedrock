# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.8  2011/09/15 16:05:33  eutl420
# - perl tidy
#
# Revision 1.7  2011/07/17 16:56:09  eutl420

#
# Revision 1.6  2011/07/12 19:10:36  eutl420
# set VERSION from cvs Revision keyword
#
# Revision 1.5  2010/11/29 15:57:54  rlauer
# - change openbedrock.org to openbedrock.net
#
# Revision 1.4  2008/12/03 14:01:20  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/02/14 15:35:50  sridhar
# Added copyright and GPL notice
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/11/16 19:08:01  sridhar
# Chomp caught exception so we don't show extra newlines. Add new line
# when rethrowing exception so we don't get `propagated ..' tacked on.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/11/13 18:37:26  sridhar
# Class which caches the body. Finalizes like WithBody but caches the
# output like Try.
