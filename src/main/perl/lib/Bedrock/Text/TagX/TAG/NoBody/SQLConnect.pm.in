# Database connection exported to the script if --dbname option is used.
#
# Revision 1.10  2000/11/16 19:11:36  sridhar
# 1. Fixed error messages so exceptions don't have perl source code
# locations in them.

# for return code and show a suitable error message
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/09/22 20:21:17  sridhar
# 1. RaiseError defaults to 1 (on)
# 2. Argument if present is treated as the data source to connect to if
# --data-source is not used.
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/08/04 17:13:07  sridhar
# BUG Fix: Return from DBI->connect was not being verified presuming
# exception would be thrown -- has been fixed.
#
# Revision 1.7  2000/05/31 14:58:03  sridhar
# Rigorous version numbering and usage
#
# Revision 1.6  2000/05/30 17:50:32  sridhar
# Options hash was specified wrongly without '=s' when it was needed.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/04/24 12:48:27  sridhar
# Using TagX::Log for logging messages
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/04/13 15:20:37  sridhar

#
# Revision 1.3  2000/03/06 18:32:00  sridhar
# Replaced all ad-hoc message logging with message logging only on demand
# -- via --verbose flag specified as a tag option
#
