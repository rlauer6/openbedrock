# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.9  2011/07/17 16:56:09  eutl420
# - build .pm from .pm.in, added @PERL@
#
# Revision 1.8  2011/07/12 19:10:37  eutl420
# set VERSION from cvs Revision keyword
#
# Revision 1.7  2010/11/29 15:57:54  rlauer
# - change openbedrock.org to openbedrock.net
#
# Revision 1.6  2008/12/03 14:01:21  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
