# Name of Release: $Name$
# $Log$
# Revision 1.6  2010/11/29 15:57:55  rlauer
# - change openbedrock.org to openbedrock.net
#
# Revision 1.5  2008/12/03 14:01:21  alans
# We now use a hard-coded value for module $VERSION rather than a munged
# version of the expansion of the CVS 'Revision' keyword; the module API
# version number is orthogonal to the identifyer in the source control
# system.
#
# This change makes it safe to import the Bedrock codebase into another
# source repository (even CVS!) without breaking the code. We hit this
# issue when we first released the libbedrock-perl .deb package, for which
# we imported the release tarball sources into the 'bedrock-deb' CVS project.
#
