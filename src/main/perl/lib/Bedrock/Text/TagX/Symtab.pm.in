# If error occurs, need to invoke `handle_error()' method so variables
# bound to code can be deleted so they are not constructed when the
# error page asks for them.
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/11/07 13:58:14  sridhar
# The Bedrock symbol table finally has a class of its own. Has an
# optimization: a variable can be bound with a `sub' which is invoked if
# the variable is referenced. This constructs the object. Might save
# some cycles for scripts which don't use many Bedrock objects.
