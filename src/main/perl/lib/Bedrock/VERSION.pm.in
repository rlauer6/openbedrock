#
# Version number is composed as follows:
#    x.y.z
# where
#    x => Version identifier changes if major changes in TagX, like
#         design changes, changing how the parser works, etc.
#    y => Identifier changes if semi-major changes in TagX, like
#         addition of new tags, removal of existing tags, major
#         changes in options to tags, etc. Change in this number
#         may indicate that older scripts will break or may cause
#         inconsistent behavior.
#    z => This changes with each bug fix, small updates or enhancements,
#         changes which may not break existing scripts (though
#         nothing is guaranteed), etc.
