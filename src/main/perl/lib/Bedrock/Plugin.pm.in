C<Bedrock::Plugin> - Base class for creating custom Bedrock Plugins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package BLM::MyPlugin;

 use vars qw(@ISA);

 use Bedrock::Plugin;

 @ISA = qw(Bedrock::Plugin);

 sub hello_world {
   my $self = shift;

   "Hello World!";
 }

 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base class for use in creating custom Bedrock I<Plugins> that can be
accessed from your web page as follows:

   <plugin:MyPlugin args ...>

   <var $MyPlugin.hello_world()>

Plugins are usually implemented based on a tied HASH, but can be
implemented as tied ARRAYs, etc. hack C<Bedrock::Plugin> as the
reference implementation.

You should override the C<init_plugin()> method if you want to return
a value when the Plugin is loaded.  The C<init_plugin()> method is
called by Bedrock immediately after calling the C<new()> method to
create the class.  C<init_plugin()> is passed the arguments specified in the tag.

  sub init_plugin {
     my $self = shift;

  }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This method is called when your plugin is instantiated.  The new
method will be passed the arguments contained in the plugin tag.  They
are stored as a Bedrock array and can be accessed using the C<args()>
method.

  <plugin:MyPlugin 1 $input.host>

  my $foo = BLM::MyPlugin->new(...);

=head2 delete

Delete a hash member.

 <var $foo.delete('SLATE')>

=head2 get 

Return a hash member

 <var $foo.get('FRED')>

=head2 init_plugin

You should override the C<init_plugin> method if you want to return a
value when the Plugin is instantiated.

=head2 keys

Returns the keys of the hash as a C<Bedrock::Array>

 <null:keys $foo.keys()>

=head2 options

Returns a C<Bedrock::Hash> object representing the initial options (not the arguments) passed in.

=head2 set

Set a hash member.

 <var $foo.set('FRED', 'A man called Flintstone.')>

=head2 values

Retrieve the hash values.

 <null:values $foo.values()>

=head2 verbose

Returns a 1 if the C<--verbose> flag was specified for this plugin.

=head1 NOTES

Plugins are meant for short perlish things you need to do that just
don't seem appropriate in a web page.  If you're implementing a lot of
application specific functionality you probably want to write an
B<Application Plugin> (I<formerly called Startup BLMs>) that will have
access to the config files and the current context object (CGI
variables, etc).

Application Plugins differ from those instantiated with the
C<E<lt>pluginE<gt>> tag in that an Application plugin is instantiated
on usage and becomes available immediate when you use them similar to
the way you use the C<$input>, C<$session> or C<$config> objects.

Plugins are perfect for including functionality you might derive from
some CPAN module that implements something terribly useful but is not
possible using core Bedrock.  There are a handful of useful plugins
that are included in the standard distribution of Bedrock, but plugins
are your way to extend Bedrock to fit your needs.
