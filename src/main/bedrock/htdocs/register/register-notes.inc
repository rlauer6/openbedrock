        This app is designed to demonstrate the use of
        the <code>$session</code> object to implement all of the
        features necessary to on-board new users. Using this
        application you can:
        <ul>
          <li>Register a new user</li>
          <li>Login and create a session</li>
          <li>Reset your password</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <div class="note border-start border-primary ps-3 bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm">
        When you register a new user, an entry is written to
        the <code>session</code> table.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <div class="note border-start border-primary ps-3 bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm">
        After you register, login using your username and
        password. A session cookie is sent to the browser to maintain
        your session. You'll now see your session data in a Session section.

    <li class="mb-3">
      <div class="note border-start border-primary ps-3 bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm">
        After you login, you have a persistent session that can be
        used to store data. When not logged in, you have an anonymous
        session that can also be used to store data that persists
        across your app's navigation. This is useful for example to
        persist data required to on-board a new user across multiple
        page requests.

        This mini-app also allows you to reset your password by using the
        <code>BLM::SMTP</code> plugin to send an email with a reset link. The reset
        link is generated by creating a temporary login session and
        including the session ID in the link. When the link is
        followed, the session will be instantiated, allowing a
        now-logged-in user to change their own password.

        Sending an email using <code>BLM::SMTP</code> relies on a working SMTP
        server in your container or your container host.  If your SMTP
        server is in your host, it must allow access to port 25. If
        you're running Postfix, you must allow Postfix to listen on
        the container's interface.
        <pre class="bg-light p-2 rounded">mynetworks = 127.0.0.1 172.17.0.0/16 192.168.0.0/16</pre>

    </li>
    <li class="mb-3">
      <div class="note border-start border-primary ps-3 bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm">
        If you're using Postfix and your configuration uses a relay,
        you must allow relaying from the sender's domain address.
        <pre class="bg-light p-2 rounded">@container.treasurersbriefcase.com email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:2587</pre>
        ...and add an entry in <code>/etc/hosts</code> with the container's IP.

      <div class="note border-start border-primary ps-3 bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm">
        A configuration file (<code>register.xml</code>) is used to
  configure the register app. The current values in the configuration
  file are:
    <pre class="session mt-3"><var --json --pretty $config.register></pre>
    Set these to the appropriate values for your environment (see
  notes above). <code>host</code> is the hostname that is running the
  application. For example if you are running this locally in a
  container <code>localhost</code> is probably correct if you are
  exposing port 80 of the container.
