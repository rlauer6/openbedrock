# Welcome to Bedrock!

Bedrock is a server side web application development framework that
can be used with Apache web servers. It allows HTML developers to
create dynamic web pages through the use of a small set of HTML-like
tags. Bedrock is an enabling technology that glues together HTML pages
and dynamic data (HTML form data, data from databases, and system
services) to create web applications. Bedrock can also be used as a
templating language from the command line.

Bedrock differs from other web application development environments
that either generate HTML pages as output (e.g. CGIs, Servlets) or are
themselves programs embedded within HTML pages (e.g. PHP, Mason, ASP,
etc) by allowing the developer to assemble pages from object oriented
components. The relatively flat learning curve associated with Bedrock
makes it ideal for prototyping, creating AJAX services, and adhoc web
applications...
