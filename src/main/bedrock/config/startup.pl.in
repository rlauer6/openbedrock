  # This might look odd, if you didn't use --with-perl-includes= to
  # configure Bedrock You can modify the line below if you want to add
  # extra include directories.  Typically, this might be done if you
  # are installing Bedrock plugins somewhere other than where Bedrock
  # was installed. For example:
  #
  # my $ax_perl5_extra_includes = "/var/www/share/perl5:/var/www/vhosts/www.foo.com/share/perl5";
  #
  # Note that directories are separated by a ':';
  #
  my $ax_perl5_extra_includes = '@ax_perl5_extra_includes@';
  push @INC, '@PERL_LIBDIR@';
  push @INC, split ':', $ax_perl5_extra_includes;
