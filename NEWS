This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'bedrock' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs are found in
any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in which they were
fixed will be noted here, as well.

bedrock 2.0.4 (2008-12-23)

    Enhancements:

      * Minor changes to modules:

            SIS::Array ( added sort() )
            SIS::Config ( added get_module_config() )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 2.0.3 (2008-12-11)

    Enhancements:

      * Minor changes to modules:

            Bedrock::Text::TagX::Expr 
            Bedrock::Text::TagX::Parser

        Added support for new unary operators and ref

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 2.0.2 (2008-12-03)

    Enhancements:

      * The Perl 5 modules in the project formerly used the expansion of the
        CVS 'Revsion' keyword when setting the module's $VERSION; such a
        scheme assumes only a single branch of development (ever!) in a single
        repository (which must be CVS or a work-alike), and changes in the
        resulting $VERSION number do not necessarily reflect changes in the
        API (unless one changes that with every commit).

        This practice has been changed to use hard-coded values for
        $VERSION. These have all been set based on the current expansion of
        'Revision', so none of module version numbers have been changed. Going
        forward, module $VERSION will only be changed to reflect API changes
        or other significant changes (as is the common practice in the Perl
        community).


    Bug Fixes:

      * Added check for 'IO::Scalar' perl module to configure-time checks.
        The IO::Scalar module comes from the 'IO-scalar' package, available
        here:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 2.0.1 (2008-11-26)

    Enhancements:

	* Apache::Bedrock will return 403 if ALLOW_BEDROCK_INFO is not
	* "yes" in tagx.xml and an attempt is made to access /bedrock

	* bedrock.cgi serves a page for a 403 error instead of
	Internal Server Error

	* Experimental use Generic.pm was removed from TagX.pm 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 2.0.0 (2008-11-25)

    Enhancements:

	* munged heavily the Apache::Bedrock module which now implements
    	all that is Bedrock 2.0.  Specifically, but not exhaustively this
	means:

	  - added support for Apache 2.x
	
	  - added support for the concept of a "controller" similar to
	    that of Struts whereby the handler knows how to navigate and
	    serve pages based on some configuration (stored in
	    tagx_apps.xml) and standards with regard to CGI variables that
	    are used to control application behavior. Extensive
	    documentation current is being written in a wiki...

	  - Apache::Bedrock is now able to barf up documentation in the
	    form of HTML pages (pod) regarding itself and it's installed
	    BLMs.  Various tags have been documented, but more needs to be
	    done!

	  - added various mechanisms for reading configuration files that
	    support the separation of applications on a virtual host.
	    Specifically:

	    + ~/config.d/startup - contains specification for startup BLMs
  	      typically contained in tagx.xml under the MODULES section

	    + ~/config.d/*.xml - contains tagx.xml like configuration files
	      that are merged with the site tagx.xml
	
	    + ~/config.d/framework/*.xml - contains configuration files that
	      contain Bedrock framework specific directives

	  - added more logging messages to Apache::Bedrock
  
	* fixed BLM::Startup::UserSession bugs (kill) and added support
	for cookieless sessions

	* new/updated tags and new tag syntax (:)

	  - <pebble>   => better than <exec --pebble=""> ????
	  - <include>  => colon syntactic candy <include:this>
	  - <open>     => could be a useless tag
	  - <blm>      => deprecated use of $Bedrock object
	  - <if>       => added --array, --object --scalar boolean operators
	  - <if>       => added --ref diadic operator that compare ref(lhs) to
	                  rhs
	  - <for>      => added options for counters, that can be arbitrarily
	                  incremented 

	* Added a few new BLMs including a startup BLM
	(BLM::Startup::Tiles) that compliments the Bedrock framework for
	building applications.

	  - BLM::Startup::Tiles - HTML component builder for Bedrock
	    framework
	  - BLM::IndexedTableHandler (and friends) - for supporting
	    applications that use MySQL tables
	  - BLM::SiteFactory - a super class used for building startup
	    BLMs
	  - BLM::DBHandler - yet another class for doing MySQL operations

	* BLM::Startup::Cookie is marginally more useful

	* bedrock running as a CGI script more intelligently handles
	situtations that should not necessarily cause an Internal Server
	Error, but rather a 404 File Not Found error

	* SIS::Log

	  - appends STDERR to the logfile, rather than letting STDERR
	    end-up in either Apache's log, or the virtual host's log file.

	  - looks to LOGDIR, cwd(), or /tmp when trying to create a log
  	    file.

	* There may in fact be some additional changes I forgot, but none
  	  that should be radical or break Bedrock applications


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 1.6.6 (2008-??-??)

    Enhancements:

        * Bedrock has been modified to work with Apache 2.x (previous
          versions only worked with Apache 1.3.x). The required
          modifications were minor. It is not yet known whether or not
          the code still works with Apache 1.3.x

        * bedrock-create-site: This is a new program that can be used to
          automate the steps necessary for setting up a Bedrock web site. The
          tool creates the necessary directory structure and config files
          based on values passed via command line params.

          By default the program does not overwrite any existing files. There
          is support for fine-grained tuning of which files should be
          overwritten.

          The program is fully documented in the man bedrock-create-site(1)
          man page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 1.6.5 (2008-02-28)

    Tagged the CVS HEAD for bedrock 1.6.5. This is mainly symbolic in that no
    testing, installation procedure, etc. has been provided for this
    release. This release is believed to be the codebase that is currently
    deployed in production at SIS on Apache 1.3.x servers. The CVS tag is:

        bedrock_1-6-5_2008-02-28


    This is also the last release on the CVS HEAD that will be targetted at
    Apache 1.3. A new branch will be created for any additional changes to the
    1.x line of development that runs on Apache 1.3.x. All future development
    on the CVS HEAD will be targetted at Apache 2.0.x.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

bedrock 1.6.4 (2001-??-??)

    Bedrock 1.6.4 was released sometime back in 2001. It's tarball was created
    by some method that has been lost to us from a CVS source repository that
    was scattered across several different modules. There are no tags on the
    bedrock files in CVS dating from the 2001 era.

    In late February 2008, using the 1.6.4 tarball as a reference point, we
    pulled the various CVS subdirectories together under a single 'bedrock'
    CVS project, tagged the HEAD revisions (which differed slightly from the
    1.6.4 revisions), and then added/removed files and downgraded file
    revisions to tag the repository for those file revsions that are the same
    as those in the bedrock 1.6.4 tarball.

    Note that this was only done for the Perl modules, not for any of the
    pebbles, "bedrock works" subproject files, etc. This compromise was made
    for the sake of efficiency: nobody actually runs the 1.6.4 bedrock code
    anymore, and our interest in it is primarily for historical reference (not
    to be able to create new 1.6.4 tarballs or actually run that version).

    Thus we have created a "retro" CVS tag for the 1.6.4 version of bedrock:

        bedrock_1-6-4_2008-02-28-retro-tag
