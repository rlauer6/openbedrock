This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'bedrock' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs are found in
any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in which they were
fixed will be noted here, as well.

bedrock 1.6.6 (2008-??-??)

    Enhancements:

        * Bedrock has been modified to work with Apache 2.x (previous
          versions only worked with Apache 1.3.x). The required
          modifications were minor. It is not yet known whether or not
          the code still works with Apache 1.3.x

        * bedrock-create-site: This is a new program that can be used to
          automate the steps necessary for setting up a Bedrock web site. The
          tool creates the necessary directory structure and config files
          based on values passed via command line params.

          By default the program does not overwrite any existing files. There
          is support for fine-grained tuning of which files should be
          overwritten.

          The program is fully documented in the man bedrock-create-site(1)
          man page.

bedrock 1.6.5 (2008-02-28)

    Tagged the CVS HEAD for bedrock 1.6.5. This is mainly symbolic in that no
    testing, installation procedure, etc. has been provided for this
    release. This release is believed to be the codebase that is currently
    deployed in production at SIS on Apache 1.3.x servers. The CVS tag is:

        bedrock_1-6-5_2008-02-28


    This is also the last release on the CVS HEAD that will be targetted at
    Apache 1.3. A new branch will be created for any additional changes to the
    1.x line of development that runs on Apache 1.3.x. All future development
    on the CVS HEAD will be targetted at Apache 2.0.x.

bedrock 1.6.4 (2001-??-??)

    Bedrock 1.6.4 was released sometime back in 2001. It's tarball was created
    by some method that has been lost to us from a CVS source repository that
    was scattered across several different modules. There are no tags on the
    bedrock files in CVS dating from the 2001 era.

    In late February 2008, using the 1.6.4 tarball as a reference point, we
    pulled the various CVS subdirectories together under a single 'bedrock'
    CVS project, tagged the HEAD revisions (which differed slightly from the
    1.6.4 revisions), and then added/removed files and downgraded file
    revisions to tag the repository for those file revsions that are the same
    as those in the bedrock 1.6.4 tarball.

    Note that this was only done for the Perl modules, not for any of the
    pebbles, "bedrock works" subproject files, etc. This compromise was made
    for the sake of efficiency: nobody actually runs the 1.6.4 bedrock code
    anymore, and our interest in it is primarily for historical reference (not
    to be able to create new 1.6.4 tarballs or actually run that version).

    Thus we have created a "retro" CVS tag for the 1.6.4 version of bedrock:

        bedrock_1-6-4_2008-02-28-retro-tag
