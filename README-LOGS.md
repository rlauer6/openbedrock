# Bedrock Logging

> WIP!

As Bedrock parses your Bedrock pages, it can produce debug output at
various log levels.

Bedrock produces output in:

* The Apache parent's error log...
* The virtual host error log...
* A Bedrock page log...
* A Bedrock handler log...

Let's start by separating Bedrock running under Apache, from Bedrock
stand-alone.

Historically, `TagX::Log` was the Bedrock _page_ logger. Messages
regarding the parsing of Bedrock tags would end up in a separate log
file for each page parsed.  For example `foo.roc` would generate a
corresponding `foo.log` containing all the log messages generated by
Bedrock for that page. By using the `--verbose` option in a tag, and
possibly a second `--verbose` to increae the verbosity, you might see
messages in the page log generated by the Perl module responsible for
parsing a particular tag.

This became a bit of a mess as well, so the notion of a single _page_
log was born, set via an option in `tagx.xml` (HTML_LOGFILE). If that
option is present, then messages are written to a single page log,
otherwise separate page logs are created.
